# About as Learn
**Observations** 
* **Tutorial Hell**: It is a vicious. When you cann't to do the project without the tutorial
* **Trying**: Ever try the project researching to do with you?
* **Consistent**: It's better to study for 30 minutes every day than to cram for 10 hours once week.
* **Set Goals**: Establish a clear, significant goal that motivates you. It could be building a company, an app, a website, or anything that personally resonates with you.

* **hand-on**: Start building projects as soon as possible. It's okay if they're simple at first; the goal is to learn and improve. Build upon code-alongs and tutorials to create your projects and learn through hands-on experience

* **How to call to help**:So how do you find that help? First off, forget books. They aren't a great place to start here, because the number and types of errors they can cover is so small. Online is the easiest place to find help. Most devs look for solutions on StackOverflow or just google the error message (if they have one). Other solutions are to find newsgroups or forums dedicated to the language you're using.
